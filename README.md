## Main Features <a name ="features"></a>
-In A-stable circuit, frequency of output is dependable on three variables (Ra ,Rb , C1)

-We used Osilloscope to measure frequency by changing values components of circuit to reach hearable sound by the speaker.

-We connected the coil series to the rheostat , when electric current flow through the coil , it creates magnetic field all around it .

-if you sweep the detector above a metal ,it cuts in the field causing change in the frequency dependable variable values for a while which cause changing in frequency which change the sound of the speaker
